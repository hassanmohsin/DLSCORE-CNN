PART I. Introduction to the PDBbind database 

The aim of the PDBbind database is to build a comprehensive collection of 
the experimentally measured binding affinity data for all types of biomolecular
complexes deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB). It provides an essential 
linkage between energetic and structural information of these complexes, which 
is helpful for various studies on molecular recognition occurred in biological 
systems. 

The PDBbind database was originally developed in Prof. Shaomeng Wang's group
at the University of Michigan. Upon a mutual agreement, this database is now 
developed and maintained by Prof. Renxiao Wang's group at the Shanghai 
Institute of Organic Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences. The PDBbind 
database is now updated on an annual base to keep up with the growth of the 
Protein Data Bank. 

This release contains PDBbind version 2016, which is based on the contents of 
PDB officially released by Jan 1st, 2016. This release provides binding data of 
a total of 16,179 biomolecular complexes, including protein-ligand (13,308), 
nucleic acid-ligand (118), protein-nucleic acid (777), and protein-protein 
complexes (1,976), which is the largest collection of this kind. Compared to 
the last release (v.2015), binding data included in this release have increased
by 11.3%. All binding data are curated by ourselves from over 29,000 original 
references. 

In addition to this data package, the users can also access the PDBbind 
database through a web-based portal at http://www.pdbbind-cn.org/.

PART III. Processed structural files of protein-ligand complexes

This data package also includes processed "clean" structural files for most 
protein-small ligand complexes in the "general set". These structural files 
can be readily utilized by most molecular modeling software. In this package, 
such structural files of 11,965 complexes are provided. An index of these 
complexes is given as "INDEX_structure.2016" under the "index/" directory. 

Note that: 
(a) Only the complexes formed by proteins and small-molecule ligands are 
    considered here. Other types of complexes, e.g. protein-protein
    and protein-nucleic acid complexes are not considered (sorry!) 
(b) A number of the protein-ligand complexes included in the general set 
    have some serious problems in their structures. Thus, such entries are not 
    included in this set.

Each complex is processed by the following methods:

(1) Each complex is saved in a subdirectory named after its PDB code:

    e.g. 1bxo/

    It is split into a protein molecule saved in the PDB format:

    e.g. 1bxo_protein.pdb

    and a ligand molecule saved in the Tripos Mol2 format and the MDL SDF 
    format:

    e.g. 1bxo_ligand.mol2 & 1bxo_ligand.sdf

    For convenience in display or analysis, another PDB file includes only 
    the binding pocket, i.e. all residues within 10A from the ligand. 

    e.g. 1bxo_pocket.pdb

(2) The protein molecule normally contains a complete "biological unit". 
    Exceptions are made only if the biological unit is too large (>3000 
    residues). In such cases, only the peptide chains that are relevant to 
    ligand binding (within 10A from the ligand) are kept. Structure of the 
    biological unit of each complex was also downloaded from PDB WITHOUT 
    furhter modifications. Note that a small number of biological units given 
    by PDB are actually problematic, but we did not attempt to fix them to 
    be consistent with PDB.  

(3) Both the protein and the ligand keep their original coordinates from PDB. 
    Hydrogen atoms are added to both molecules using stardard bond lengths 
    and bond angles. Coordinates of all atoms, including non-hydrogen atoms 
    and hydrogen atoms, have NOT been further optimized so that they are the 
    same as those in the original PDB files. 

(4) When adding hydrogen atoms to the protein and the ligand, a "default" 
    (or naive) protonation scheme under neutral pH condition are applied to 
    both molecules. On the protein side, Asp, Glu, and His residues are 
    deprotonated; while Lys and Arg residues are protonated; on the ligand 
    side, carboxylic, sulfonic, and phosphoric acid groups are deprotonated; 
    while aliphatic amine groups, guanidine and amidine groups are protonated.

(5) For each protein molecule, all of the atoms are re-numbered continuously 
    starting from 1 for the sake of convenience. But their residue numbers 
    and chain labels remain the same as those in the original PDB files. 
    Metal ions and water molecules are saved with the protein molecule in 
    the HETATM section. 

(6) The chemical structure of each ligand molecule was interpreted with a 
    special computer program based on the original PDB file. It was then 
    examined manually to correct atom/bond types if necessary. Gasteiger-Huckel
    partial charges are assigned on each ligand molecule.

PART IV. The "refined set" and the "core set"

As an additional value of PDBbind, some protein-ligand complexes are selected 
into high-quality data sets, i.e. the "refined set" and the "core set". Both
data sets have been widely applied by users worldwide in the development and 
validation of docking/scoring methods. 

The complexes in the "refined set" are selected out of the "general set" with 
a number of filters, addressing the quality of the complex structure as well as 
binding data. Complexes of the following types are NOT accepted into the 
"refined set":

(1) Concerns on the quality of structures  

    (a) Not a crystal structure, resolution>2.5A, or R-factor>0.250.
    (b) The ligand is bound to the protein through a covalent bond.
    (c) Is a ternary complex, i.e. multiple ligands binding at the same site.
    (d) Obvious steric clashes (<2.0A) exist between ligand and protein.
    (e) Ratio of the buried solvent-accessible surface of the ligand <15%.
    (f) Non-standard residues are in direct contact with the ligand, or there
        are missing fragments on the backbone or sidechain of any pocket
        residue.
    (g) The ligand contains uncommon elements, such as B, Be, Si, and metal.
    (i) There is missing fragment on the ligand structure. 
    (h) Molecular weight of the ligand >1000 if it is a regular organic 
        molecule, or it contains >=10 residues if it is a peptide or peptide 
        mimic.

(2) Concerns on the quality of binding data

    (a) The binding data are given as IC50 value rather than Kd and Ki.
    (b) The binding data are not exact values, e.g. Kd~1pM, Ki<10uM.
    (c) The binding data fall out of the desired range, i.e. logKa<2.00 
        (Kd>10mM) or logKa>=12.00 (Kd<=1pM).
    (d) The protein used in binding assay does not match the one in crystal
        structure, e.g. of different subtypes, mutants, or species.
    (e) The ligand used in binding assay does not match the one in crystal
        structure, e.g. in different forms or having missing fragments. 
    (f) The protein binds with two ligand molecules at two binding sites, 
        which are associated with two binding constants, e.g. Kd1 and Kd2, 
        and they are significantly different (>10 folds).

The latest set of rules are described in our recent publication (Li, Y. et al. 
J. Chem. Inf. Model., 2014, 54, 1700-1716). In this release, the "refined set" 
is composed of 4,057 selected protein-ligand complexes. 

Then, a "core set" is selected out of it as a representative non-redundant 
subset. Compilation of the "core set" aims at providing a relatively small set 
of high-quality protein-ligand complexes with emphasis on diversity in 
structures and binding data. It serves as a standard test set for docking/
scoring studies. In particular, the "core set" serves as the primary test set
in our Comparative Assessment of Scoring Functions (CASF) benchmark.(Li, Y. 
et al. J. Chem. Inf. Model., 2014, 54, 1717-1736; Cheng, T.J. et al. J. Chem. 
Inf. Model., 2009, 49, 1079-1093).
 
The "core set" in this release (v.2016) is selected through a new procedure.
In brief:

(1) The complexes included in the refined set are clustered by protein 
    sequence similarity with a cutoff value of 90%. Only the clusters with 
    at least 5 members are considered. 

(2) In each remaining cluster, the complex with the highest binding 
    affinity (the top), the one with the lowest binding affinity (the
    bottom), and three complexes with binding affinities between the two 
    extremes are selected as the representatives of this cluster. Binding 
    constant of the top complex must be at least 100-fold higher than the 
    one of the bottom complex. In addition, binding constants of any two 
    complexes must differ by at least one fold (i.e. 0.30 log units). 

(3) The ligand molecule in each selected complex is compared to other ligand
    molecules in this data set to ensure its uniqueness, i.e. it cannot be 
    included in another cluster (i.e. cross-binders to multiple targets) or a 
    stereoisomer (e.g. R/S enantiomer) of another ligand molecule.  

(4) Each selected complex must have the electron density map (E-map) along 
    with its crystal structure from PDB. Their E-maps are visually inspected
    to ensure that there are no obvious problems in fitting the ligand 
    molecule as well as nearby pocket residues to the electron density contours.  
As result, the final "core set" in this release (v.2016) is composed of 290 
protein-ligand complexes in 58 clusters. This data set has been applied to
our CASF-2016 benchmark, which will be described in our up-coming publication.

PART V. Special notes

(1) On the definition of protein-protein complexes

If the ligand molecule in a complex is a peptide, it could be arguable if this 
complex should be classified as a "protein-ligand complex" or a 
"protein-protein complex". In this release, the definition of a valid 
"protein-protein" complex is that both molecules in a protein-protein complex 
must consist of at least 20 residues. If either molecule is a peptide shorter
than 20 residues, it is classified as a "protein-ligand complex". 

(2) On the core set

The core set is designed to serve as a high-quality benchmark for validation
of scoring/docking methods. The core set is not updated with each release of
PDBbind. The primary reason is that the core set serves as the primary test 
set of our CASF benchmark. To utilize the core set in a more meaningful way, 
the users also need the additional data and material supplied with the CASF 
benchmark. Therefore, we have decided that a new PDBbind core set will be 
provided only with a new release of the CASF benchmark. This release does 
contains a new core set, i.e. core set v.2016. We plan to release a new 
CASF benchmark (and thus a new core set) roughly every three years.
